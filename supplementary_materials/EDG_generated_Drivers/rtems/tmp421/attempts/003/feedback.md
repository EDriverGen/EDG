## ATTEMPT 3 FEEDBACK

### Confirmed Invariants (sticky across rounds)
- [byte-order] raw reads decode as big endian u32 (attempt 1, evidence: stim `zero_near_zero` matched big_endian_u32)
- [compile-includes] `#include "rtems.h"` resolved cleanly under stub_compile — KEEP this exact include (do NOT switch to a different vendor / cross-family / LL header in the next attempt) (attempt 1, evidence: L1 syntax compile passed for driver_header+driver_source)
- [compile-includes] `#include "tmp421.h"` resolved cleanly under stub_compile — KEEP this exact include (do NOT switch to a different vendor / cross-family / LL header in the next attempt) (attempt 1, evidence: L1 syntax compile passed for driver_header+driver_source)
- [compile-includes] `#include <errno.h>` resolved cleanly under stub_compile — KEEP this exact include (do NOT switch to a different vendor / cross-family / LL header in the next attempt) (attempt 1, evidence: L1 syntax compile passed for driver_header+driver_source)
- [compile-includes] `#include <fcntl.h>` resolved cleanly under stub_compile — KEEP this exact include (do NOT switch to a different vendor / cross-family / LL header in the next attempt) (attempt 1, evidence: L1 syntax compile passed for driver_header+driver_source)
- [compile-includes] `#include <linux/i2c-dev.h>` resolved cleanly under stub_compile — KEEP this exact include (do NOT switch to a different vendor / cross-family / LL header in the next attempt) (attempt 1, evidence: L1 syntax compile passed for driver_header+driver_source)
- [compile-includes] `#include <linux/i2c.h>` resolved cleanly under stub_compile — KEEP this exact include (do NOT switch to a different vendor / cross-family / LL header in the next attempt) (attempt 1, evidence: L1 syntax compile passed for driver_header+driver_source)
- [compile-includes] `#include <stddef.h>` resolved cleanly under stub_compile — KEEP this exact include (do NOT switch to a different vendor / cross-family / LL header in the next attempt) (attempt 1, evidence: L1 syntax compile passed for driver_header+driver_source)
- [compile-includes] `#include <stdint.h>` resolved cleanly under stub_compile — KEEP this exact include (do NOT switch to a different vendor / cross-family / LL header in the next attempt) (attempt 1, evidence: L1 syntax compile passed for driver_header+driver_source)
- [compile-includes] `#include <sys/ioctl.h>` resolved cleanly under stub_compile — KEEP this exact include (do NOT switch to a different vendor / cross-family / LL header in the next attempt) (attempt 1, evidence: L1 syntax compile passed for driver_header+driver_source)
- [compile-includes] `#include <unistd.h>` resolved cleanly under stub_compile — KEEP this exact include (do NOT switch to a different vendor / cross-family / LL header in the next attempt) (attempt 1, evidence: L1 syntax compile passed for driver_header+driver_source)
- [init-opcode] init phase must write [0xFE] to addr 0x2A (attempt 1, evidence: operation_flows[0].steps[0])
- [init-opcode] init phase must write [0xFF] to addr 0x2A (attempt 1, evidence: operation_flows[0].steps[1])
- [init-opcode] phase=read_cycle requires write [0x00] to addr 0x2A (attempt 1, evidence: operation_flows[1].steps[1])
- [init-opcode] phase=read_cycle requires write [0x01] to addr 0x2A (attempt 1, evidence: operation_flows[2].steps[1])
- [init-opcode] phase=read_cycle requires write [0x10] to addr 0x2A (attempt 1, evidence: operation_flows[1].steps[2])
- [init-opcode] phase=read_cycle requires write [0x11] to addr 0x2A (attempt 1, evidence: operation_flows[2].steps[2])
- [runtime-pass] stim `zero_near_zero` passed on Renode (multi_channel match) (attempt 2, evidence: Stage 6 result_pass=True, test_done=True)

### Stimulus self-check
- 2 stimulus/stimuli were not statically checkable before Renode:
  - `nominal_positive`: no channel could be L1-verified
  - `negative_twos_complement`: no channel could be L1-verified

### Runtime probe (Renode)
- 2 of 3 stimulus vector(s) failed in Renode:
  - `nominal_positive` [expectation_mismatch]: firmware printed RESULT: PASS but generated test expectations did not match observed output: channel temp_remote expected=27000 got=26500 tol=0 first_i2c_read_rx=[0xFF]. If observed and expected differ mainly by a scale factor (for example base units vs milli-units), fix the driver/API unit conversion and keep `expected_*` tied to the public adapter output unit; do not merely change the test expected value to match an incorrectly scaled driver result.
  - `negative_twos_complement` [expectation_mismatch]: firmware printed RESULT: PASS but generated test expectations did not match observed output: channel temp_local expected=-10000 got=246500 tol=0 first_i2c_read_rx=[0xFF]; channel temp_remote expected=-10000 got=246500 tol=0 first_i2c_read_rx=[0xFF]. If observed and expected differ mainly by a scale factor (for example base units vs milli-units), fix the driver/API unit conversion and keep `expected_*` tied to the public adapter output unit; do not merely change the test expected value to match an incorrectly scaled driver result.

### Task
- Respect every invariant above.
- Fix every issue marked as an error; they are blocking.
- Address warnings where feasible; justify via Stage 6 outcomes when you deliberately leave one.
- Regenerate all 4 top-level JSON keys (`driver_header`, `driver_source`, `api_contract`, `test_plan`) as a single bare JSON object.
