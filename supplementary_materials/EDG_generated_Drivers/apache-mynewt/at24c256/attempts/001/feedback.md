## ATTEMPT 1 FEEDBACK

### Confirmed Invariants (sticky across rounds)
- [compile-includes] `#include "apache_mynewt.h"` resolved cleanly under stub_compile — KEEP this exact include (do NOT switch to a different vendor / cross-family / LL header in the next attempt) (attempt 1, evidence: L1 syntax compile passed for driver_header+driver_source)
- [compile-includes] `#include "at24c256.h"` resolved cleanly under stub_compile — KEEP this exact include (do NOT switch to a different vendor / cross-family / LL header in the next attempt) (attempt 1, evidence: L1 syntax compile passed for driver_header+driver_source)
- [compile-includes] `#include <assert.h>` resolved cleanly under stub_compile — KEEP this exact include (do NOT switch to a different vendor / cross-family / LL header in the next attempt) (attempt 1, evidence: L1 syntax compile passed for driver_header+driver_source)
- [compile-includes] `#include <stddef.h>` resolved cleanly under stub_compile — KEEP this exact include (do NOT switch to a different vendor / cross-family / LL header in the next attempt) (attempt 1, evidence: L1 syntax compile passed for driver_header+driver_source)
- [compile-includes] `#include <stdint.h>` resolved cleanly under stub_compile — KEEP this exact include (do NOT switch to a different vendor / cross-family / LL header in the next attempt) (attempt 1, evidence: L1 syntax compile passed for driver_header+driver_source)
- [init-opcode] phase=read_cycle requires write <read> to addr 0x50 (attempt 1, evidence: operation_flows[3].steps[0])

### Runtime probe (Renode)
- 2 of 2 stimulus vector(s) failed in Renode:
  - `mechanical_memory_probe_1` [memory_mismatch]: memory readback mismatch: expected='DEADBEEF1032547689ABCDEF01234567' got=''
  - `mechanical_memory_probe_2` [memory_mismatch]: memory readback mismatch: expected='00FF55AA123456789ABCFEDC11223344' got=''

### Task
- Respect every invariant above.
- Fix every issue marked as an error; they are blocking.
- Address warnings where feasible; justify via Stage 6 outcomes when you deliberately leave one.
- Regenerate all 4 top-level JSON keys (`driver_header`, `driver_source`, `api_contract`, `test_plan`) as a single bare JSON object.
