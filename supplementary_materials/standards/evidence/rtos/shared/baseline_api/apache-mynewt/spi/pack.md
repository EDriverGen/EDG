/** @brief Reset the Handle's State field.
  * @param __HANDLE__ specifies the Peripheral Handle.
  * @note  This macro can be used for the following purpose:
  *          - When the Handle is declared as local variable; before passing it as parameter
  *            to HAL_PPP_Init() for the first time, it is mandatory to use this macro
  *            to set to 0 the Handle's "State" field.
  *            Otherwise, "State" field may have any random value and the first time the function
  *            HAL_PPP_Init() is called, the low level hardware initialization will be missed
  *            (i.e. HAL_PPP_MspInit() will not be executed).
  *          - When there is a need to reconfigure the low level hardware: instead of calling
  *            HAL_PPP_DeInit() then HAL_PPP_Init(), user can make a call to this macro then HAL_PPP_Init().
  *            In this later function, when the Handle's "State" field is set to 0, it will execute the function
  *            HAL_PPP_MspInit() which will reconfigure the low level hardware.
  * @retval None

  ==============================================================================
                        ##### How to use this driver #####
  ==============================================================================
    [..]
      The SPI HAL driver can be used as follows:

      (#) Declare a SPI_HandleTypeDef handle structure, for example:
          SPI_HandleTypeDef  hspi;

      (#)Initialize the SPI low level resources by implementing the HAL_SPI_MspInit() API:
          (##) Enable the SPIx interface clock
          (##) SPI pins configuration
              (+++) Enable the clock for the SPI GPIOs
              (+++) Configure these SPI pins as alternate function push-pull
          (##) NVIC configuration if you need to use interrupt process
              (+++) Configure the SPIx interrupt priority
              (+++) Enable the NVIC SPI IRQ handle
          (##) DMA Configuration if you need to use DMA process
              (+++) Declare a DMA_HandleTypeDef handle structure for the transmit or receive Stream/Channel
              (+++) Enable the DMAx clock
              (+++) Configure the DMA handle parameters
              (+++) Configure the DMA Tx or Rx Stream/Channel
              (+++) Associate the initialized hdma_tx(or _rx)  handle to the hspi DMA Tx or Rx handle
              (+++) Configure the priority and enable the NVIC for the transfer complete interrupt on the DMA Tx
                    or Rx Stream/Channel

      (#) Program the Mode, BidirectionalMode , Data size, Baudrate Prescaler, NSS
          management, Clock polarity and phase, FirstBit and CRC configuration in the hspi Init structure.

      (#) Initialize the SPI registers by calling the HAL_SPI_Init() API:
          (++) This API configures also the low level Hardware GPIO, CLOCK, CORTEX...etc)
              by calling the customized HAL_SPI_MspInit() API.
     [..]
       Circular mode restriction:
      (#) The DMA circular mode cannot be used when the SPI is configured in these modes:
          (##) Master 2Lines RxOnly
          (##) Master 1Line Rx
      (#) The CRC feature is not managed when the DMA circular mode is enabled
      (#) When the SPI DMA Pause/Stop features are used, we must use the following APIs
          the HAL_SPI_DMAPause()/ HAL_SPI_DMAStop() only under the SPI callbacks
     [..]
       Master Receive mode restriction:
      (#) In Master unidirectional receive-only mode (MSTR =1, BIDIMODE=0, RXONLY=1) or
          bidirectional receive mode (MSTR=1, BIDIMODE=1, BIDIOE=0), to ensure that the SPI
          does not initiate a new transfer the following procedure has to be respected:
          (##) HAL_SPI_DeInit()
          (##) HAL_SPI_Init()
     [..]
       Callback registration:

      (#) The compilation flag USE_HAL_SPI_REGISTER_CALLBACKS when set to 1U
          allows the user to configure dynamically the driver callbacks.
          Use Functions HAL_SPI_RegisterCallback() to register an interrupt callback.

          Function HAL_SPI_RegisterCallback() allows to register following callbacks:
            (++) TxCpltCallback        : SPI Tx Completed callback
            (++) RxCpltCallback        : SPI Rx Completed callback
            (++) TxRxCpltCallback      : SPI TxRx Completed callback
            (++) TxHalfCpltCallback    : SPI Tx Half Completed callback
            (++) RxHalfCpltCallback    : SPI Rx Half Completed callback
            (++) TxRxHalfCpltCallback  : SPI TxRx Half Completed callback
            (++) ErrorCallback         : SPI Error callback
            (++) AbortCpltCallback     : SPI Abort callback
            (++) MspInitCallback       : SPI Msp Init callback
            (++) MspDeInitCallback     : SPI Msp DeInit callback
          This function takes as parameters the HAL peripheral handle, the Callback ID
          and a pointer to the user callback function.


      (#) Use function HAL_SPI_UnRegisterCallback to reset a callback to the default
          weak function.
          HAL_SPI_UnRegisterCallback takes as parameters the HAL peripheral handle,
          and the Callback ID.
          This function allows to reset following callbacks:
            (++) TxCpltCallback        : SPI Tx Completed callback
            (++) RxCpltCallback        : SPI Rx Completed callback
            (++) TxRxCpltCallback      : SPI TxRx Completed callback
            (++) TxHalfCpltCallback    : SPI Tx Half Completed callback
            (++) RxHalfCpltCallback    : SPI Rx Half Completed callback
            (++) TxRxHalfCpltCallback  : SPI TxRx Half Completed callback
            (++) ErrorCallback         : SPI Error callback
            (++) AbortCpltCallback     : SPI Abort callback
            (++) MspInitCallback       : SPI Msp Init callback
            (++) MspDeInitCallback     : SPI Msp DeInit callback

       [..]
       By default, after the HAL_SPI_Init() and when the state is HAL_SPI_STATE_RESET
       all callbacks are set to the corresponding weak functions:
       examples HAL_SPI_MasterTxCpltCallback(), HAL_SPI_MasterRxCpltCallback().
       Exception done for MspInit and MspDeInit functions that are
       reset to the legacy weak functions in the HAL_SPI_Init()/ HAL_SPI_DeInit() only when
       these callbacks are null (not registered beforehand).
       If MspInit or MspDeInit are not null, the HAL_SPI_Init()/ HAL_SPI_DeInit()
       keep and use the user MspInit/MspDeInit callbacks (registered beforehand) whatever the state.

       [..]
       Callbacks can be registered/unregistered in HAL_SPI_STATE_READY state only.
       Exception done MspInit/MspDeInit functions that can be registered/unregistered
       in HAL_SPI_STATE_READY or HAL_SPI_STATE_RESET state,
       thus registered (user) MspInit/DeInit callbacks can be used during the Init/DeInit.
       Then, the user first registers the MspInit/MspDeInit user callbacks
       using HAL_SPI_RegisterCallback() before calling HAL_SPI_DeInit()
       or HAL_SPI_Init() function.

       [..]
       When the compilation define USE_HAL_PPP_REGISTER_CALLBACKS is set to 0 or
       not defined, the callback registering feature is not available
       and weak (surcharged) callbacks are used.

     [..]
       Using the HAL it is not possible to reach all supported SPI frequency with the different SPI Modes,
       the following table resume the max SPI frequency reached with data size 8bits/16bits,
         according to frequency of the APBx Peripheral Clock (fPCLK) used by the SPI instance.

  ==============================================================================
                    ##### GPIO Peripheral features #####
  ==============================================================================
  [..]
  Subject to the specific hardware characteristics of each I/O port listed in the datasheet, each
  port bit of the General Purpose IO (GPIO) Ports, can be individually configured by software
  in several modes:
  (+) Input mode
  (+) Analog mode
  (+) Output mode
  (+) Alternate function mode
  (+) External interrupt/event lines

  [..]
  During and just after reset, the alternate functions and external interrupt
  lines are not active and the I/O ports are configured in input floating mode.

  [..]
  All GPIO pins have weak internal pull-up and pull-down resistors, which can be
  activated or not.

  [..]
  In Output or Alternate mode, each IO can be configured on open-drain or push-pull
  type and the IO speed can be selected depending on the VDD value.

  [..]
  All ports have external interrupt/event capability. To use external interrupt
  lines, the port must be configured in input mode. All available GPIO pins are
  connected to the 16 external interrupt/event lines from EXTI0 to EXTI15.

  [..]
  The external interrupt/event controller consists of up to 20 edge detectors in connectivity
  line devices, or 19 edge detectors in other devices for generating event/interrupt requests.
  Each input line can be independently configured to select the type (event or interrupt) and
  the corresponding trigger event (rising or falling or both). Each line can also masked
  independently. A pending register maintains the status line of the interrupt requests

                     ##### How to use this driver #####
  ==============================================================================
 [..]
   (#) Enable the GPIO APB2 clock using the following function : __HAL_RCC_GPIOx_CLK_ENABLE().

   (#) Configure the GPIO pin(s) using HAL_GPIO_Init().
       (++) Configure the IO mode using "Mode" member from GPIO_InitTypeDef structure
       (++) Activate Pull-up, Pull-down resistor using "Pull" member from GPIO_InitTypeDef
            structure.
       (++) In case of Output or alternate function mode selection: the speed is
            configured through "Speed" member from GPIO_InitTypeDef structure
       (++) Analog mode is required when a pin is to be used as ADC channel
            or DAC output.
       (++) In case of external interrupt/event selection the "Mode" member from
            GPIO_InitTypeDef structure select the type (interrupt or event) and
            the corresponding trigger event (rising or falling or both).

   (#) In case of external interrupt/event mode selection, configure NVIC IRQ priority
       mapped to the EXTI line using HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() and enable it using
       HAL_NVIC_EnableIRQ().

   (#) To get the level of a pin configured in input mode use HAL_GPIO_ReadPin().

   (#) To set/reset the level of a pin configured in output mode use
       HAL_GPIO_WritePin()/HAL_GPIO_TogglePin().

   (#) To lock pin configuration until next reset use HAL_GPIO_LockPin().

   (#) During and just after reset, the alternate functions are not
       active and the GPIO pins are configured in input floating mode (except JTAG
       pins).

   (#) The LSE oscillator pins OSC32_IN and OSC32_OUT can be used as general purpose
       (PC14 and PC15, respectively) when the LSE oscillator is off. The LSE has
       priority over the GPIO function.

   (#) The HSE oscillator pins OSC_IN/OSC_OUT can be used as
       general purpose PD0 and PD1, respectively, when the HSE oscillator is off.
       The HSE has priority over the GPIO function.

          configuration. It initializes the systick also when timeout is needed
          and the backup domain when enabled.
      (+) de-Initializes common part of the HAL.
      (+) Configure The time base source to have 1ms time base with a dedicated
          Tick interrupt priority.
        (++) SysTick timer is used by default as source of time base, but user
             can eventually implement his proper time base source (a general purpose
             timer for example or other time source), keeping in mind that Time base
             duration should be kept 1ms since PPP_TIMEOUT_VALUEs are defined and
             handled in milliseconds basis.
        (++) Time base configuration function (HAL_InitTick ()) is called automatically
             at the beginning of the program after reset by HAL_Init() or at any time
             when clock is configured, by HAL_RCC_ClockConfig().
        (++) Source of time base is configured  to generate interrupts at regular
             time intervals. Care must be taken if HAL_Delay() is called from a

            (numerically lower) than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller
            ISR process will be blocked.
       (++) functions affecting time base configurations are declared as __weak

  * @brief   CMSIS Cortex-M3 Device Peripheral Access Layer System Source File.
  * 
  * 1.  This file provides two functions and one global variable to be called from 
  *     user application:
  *      - SystemInit(): Setups the system clock (System clock source, PLL Multiplier
  *                      factors, AHB/APBx prescalers and Flash settings). 
  *                      This function is called at startup just after reset and 
  *                      before branch to main program. This call is made inside
  *                      the "startup_stm32f1xx_xx.s" file.
  *
  *      - SystemCoreClock variable: Contains the core clock (HCLK), it can be used
  *                                  by the user application to setup the SysTick 
  *                                  timer or configure other parameters.
  *                                     
  *      - SystemCoreClockUpdate(): Updates the variable SystemCoreClock and must
  *                                 be called whenever the core clock is changed
  *                                 during program execution.
  *
  * 2. After each device reset the HSI (8 MHz) is used as system clock source.
  *    Then SystemInit() function is called, in "startup_stm32f1xx_xx.s" file, to
  *    configure the system clock before to branch to main program.
  *
  * 4. The default value of HSE crystal is set to 8 MHz (or 25 MHz, depending on
  *    the product used), refer to "HSE_VALUE". 
  *    When HSE is used as system clock source, directly or through PLL, and you
  *    are using different crystal you have to adapt the HSE value to your own
  *    configuration.

SPI
========

SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) is a synchronous 4-wire serial
interface commonly used to connect components in embedded systems.

For a detailed description of SPI, see
`Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface_Bus>`__.

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

The Mynewt HAL interface supports the SPI master functionality with both
blocking and non-blocking interface. SPI slave functionality is
supported in non-blocking mode.


Theory Of Operation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SPI is called a 4-wire interface because of the 4 signals, MISO, MOSI,
CLK, and SS. The SS signal (slave select) is an active low signal that
activates a SPI slave device. This is how a master "addresses" a
particular slave device. Often this signal is also referred to as "chip
select" as it selects particular slave device for communications.

The Mynewt SPI HAL has blocking and non-blocking transfers. Blocking
means that the API call to transfer a byte will wait until the byte
completes transmissions before the function returns. Blocking interface
can be used for only the master slave SPI type. Non-blocking means he
function returns control to the execution environment immediately after
the API call and a callback function is executed at the completion of
the transmission. Non-blocking interface can be used for both master and
slave SPI types.

The ``hal_spi_config`` method in the API above allows the SPI to be
configured with appropriate settings for master or slave. It Must be
called after the spi is initialized (i.e. after hal\_spi\_init is
called) and when the spi is disabled (i.e. user must call
hal\_spi\_disable if the spi has been enabled through hal\_spi\_enable
prior to calling this function). It can also be used to reconfigure an
initialized SPI (assuming it is disabled as described previously).

.. code:: c

    int hal_spi_config(int spi_num, struct hal_spi_settings *psettings);

The SPI settings consist of the following:

.. code:: c

    struct hal_spi_settings {
        uint8_t         data_mode;
        uint8_t         data_order;
        uint8_t         word_size;
        uint32_t        baudrate;           /* baudrate in kHz */
    };

The Mynewt SPI HAL does not include built-in SS (Slave Select)
signaling. It's up to the hal\_spi user to control their own SS pins.
Typically applications will do this with GPIO.

CPU Time
========

The MyNewt ``cputime`` module provides high resolution time and timer
support.

Description
-----------

The ``cputime`` API provides high resolution time and timer support. The
module must be initialized, using the :c:func:`os_cputime_init()` function,
with the clock frequency to use. The module uses the ``hal_timer`` API,
defined in hal/hal_timer.h, to access the hardware timers. It uses the
hardware timer number specified by the ``OS_CPUTIME_TIMER_NUM`` system
configuration setting.
